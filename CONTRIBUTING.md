Thank you for your interest in contributing. 

Currently, this is a one-woman project and there are no strict coding conventions yet.

The only prerequisite is to don't be an asshole and follow the Code of Conduct.

Feel free to fork and help improving the project by creating a pull request.

Don't be shy. Aside to code changes, help improving the documentation,
this contribution guideline or the description of open issues is highly appreciated.

Cheers,

Lea
